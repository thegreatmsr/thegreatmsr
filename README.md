ABOUT ME:- As a seasoned Senior Customer Executive, I excel in building and maintaining strong relationships with clients, ensuring their needs are met while driving business growth. My background in customer service has equipped me with exceptional communication and problem-solving skills, enabling me to effectively address client concerns and deliver tailored solutions.

In addition to my customer-facing experience, I am passionate about software development. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and Java, I leverage my technical skills to enhance customer experiences and streamline processes. My understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) allows me to approach challenges analytically, creating efficient solutions.

I am also skilled in MS Excel, which helps me analyze data and generate insightful reports to inform decision-making. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can combine my customer-centric mindset with my technical expertise to deliver impactful results.
